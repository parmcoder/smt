# SMT — Product Concept

SMT gives Sanovy developers and Codex agents one inspectable tool for a root
Git repository with independent submodules. It creates a reviewable blueprint
before applying a local platform workspace, then safely coordinates its normal
Git lifecycle without hiding state.

Its local workflow is:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[smt new] --> B[Inspect and edit smt.yaml]
    B --> C[smt apply PATH]
    C --> D[Configure remote URLs]
    D --> E[status or doctor]
    E --> F[Optionally install safe hooks]
    F --> G[Run named check profile]
    G --> H[Push children then root]
    G --> I[Create synchronized worktree]
    G --> M[prepare active Beads branch]
    M --> N[switch existing branch]
    N --> O[pull child-first]
    G --> J[Validate CI contracts]
    J --> K[Plan guarded literal bump]
    K --> L[Apply only with explicit approval]
```

Safety is the product: argument-array execution, an explicit blueprint review
before workspace creation, complete preflight before push/worktree side
effects, child-first pushes, root-first worktree creation, path containment,
harmless OS metadata filtering, no credential persistence, and no automatic
hook overwrite. A workspace hook install is all-repository-preflighted, then
root-first; it never forces, overwrites an unmanaged hook, or rolls back an
earlier install. Cobra groups
the discoverable command tree into Getting Started, Workspace, Review
Workflow, and Developer Tools; help and generated shell completion work
without workspace configuration. The current CLI covers blueprint creation and
application, inspection, safe hook installation, checks, contracts, CI audits,
guarded contract bumps, configured pushes, linked worktrees, Beads-branch
preparation/switching, child-first pulls, and release
readiness. The release path is deliberately split: `release:build` makes four
local archives and checksums, while a clean `release:tag` creates and pushes an
annotated version tag. GitHub Actions now publishes a GitHub Release from that
tag with the four archives and checksum file.

Direct provider-native release CLI orchestration does not exist, and GitLab
release automation does not exist. Remote repository creation, external-clone
submodule URL synchronization, workspace submit orchestration, Jira aliases,
assignment waves, provider review automation, cloud or database actions,
deployment, rollback, and credential storage remain outside the current product
boundary.

Human `status` and `doctor` reports emphasize the next safe action. `doctor`
defaults to action-first output and offers `--tree` plus safe `--verbose` detail.
`status
--json` is intentionally separate for automation. Both may say that a
`commit-msg` hook is absent, current, or unmanaged; an unmanaged hook is a
human decision, never something SMT replaces. Generated `lefthook.yml` is a
scaffold, not proof that Lefthook has run or that a hook was installed.
